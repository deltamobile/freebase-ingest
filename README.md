===============

Scripts for loading the Freebase RDF Dump into a triple store.

Someone with the Apache Foundation, possibly Andrew Franklin Seaborne,
create a Perl script and some notes on loading a Freebase dump into
a triple store here:

http://people.apache.org/~andy/Freebase20121223/

This project contains an updated version of the Perl script that
addresses some issues we encounted when loading Freebase onto one
of our systems.  You should probably read through the notes there
first.
